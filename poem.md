What dumb shit.iOUc And edit this part too. Run a marathon.
How badly
Enough of THIS stuff nonsense, Charlie
you happy, poOr thinker, you who
And nibbling things of hers
I have added one line
And another line
And a third. All in a row.
Swirl at your ankles
As you *proceed* alongside
Nu?
Hello Tom this my poEm
To you For 
.
On the outside
And by the way, run a marathon.
Moderate the body's energies,
Keep the bitter and the sour in right
Proportion. After 


Ouch.all, you bathe
Arrant nonsense.
You rankle me.
As she leads me out to sea.
