How badly
Enough of this stuff, Charlie
The way of things, your mistress,
Defies reason;
You happy, poor thinker, you who
Lays up your agreeable, continuous slats,
Your elegances;

Moderate the body's energies,
Keep the bitter and the sour in right
Proportion. After

Regularly. Poorly And the world will unfold
As she leads me out to sea.
