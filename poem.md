How badly
Enough of this stuff, Charlie
The way of things, your mistress,
You happy, poor thinker, you who
Your elegances;
And nibbling things of hers
Swirl at your ankles
As you *proceed* alongside
Nu?
Hello Tom this my poem
What am I doing
To you.
On the outside
And by the way, run a marathon.
Eat a canteloupe.
Moderate the body's energies,
Keep the bitter and the sour in right
Proportion. After 
3dyun34
all, you bathe
You rankle me.
Understand.
As she leads me out to sea.
